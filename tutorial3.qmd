## Part 3 - Tailoring Model Inputs to Local Contexts

In this section, we’ll focus on tailoring the inputs needed to run 
malariasimulation for a specific geography or context. 
We’ll discuss how the site package and its associated country site files can 
provide a systematic starting point for context-specific malaria modelling runs.
By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:

* Understand how country site files collate essential data for all 
malaria-endemic countries.
* Identify the data inputs required for malaria simulations and where they come 
from.
* Use the site package to convert country information into malariasimulation 
parameters.
* Run a model for a single site
* Understand the limitations of using global datasets.

## Systematically Collating Data into Country Site Files

Running malariasimulation for a specific context requires diverse data inputs, 
including historical interventions, seasonality, population demography, and 
mosquito population characteristics. 
Collecting this information systematically across all malaria-endemic countries 
is no small task. To address this, the country site files consolidate these 
inputs for each country using globally available datasets.

The site files aim to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant data for each 
malaria-endemic country. This includes ecological, demographic, and 
intervention-specific information, which serves as a starting point for 
simulations. 
But please note: 

⚠️ It is essential to review these data critically before applying them to your 
specific context.
⚠️ If using a site file, it is important that you correctly reference each data 
input - referecing the site package alone isn't enough!

To explore the full range of inputs included in the country site files, see the 
detailed documentation on the site website.
Introducing the site Package

The site package provides tools to access and utilise the country site files for 
malaria modelling.This R package simplifies the process of tailoring your 
modelling inputs by:

### Providing Access to Country Site Files
You can sign up for access to the site files and download them directly. 
Detailed instructions on how to do this, along with an example, are available here..........

### Converting Country Information into Simulation Parameters
Once downloaded, the site package allows you to convert the collated 
country-specific data into the input parameters required by malariasimulation. 
This includes calibrating baseline transmission, seasonal patterns, and 
intervention histories to the context of your chosen geography.

Limitations of the Country Site Files

While the site files offer a valuable starting point for malaria modelling, 
there are some important caveats to keep in mind:

⚠️ Data Coarseness
The site files are based on globally available datasets, and some inputs are 
only available at the country level. This means that the spatial and temporal 
resolution of the data may be too coarse for detailed local analyses. If you are
using a site file for context-specific modelling, it is highly recommended to 
review and incorporate any additional local data that may be available to refine
and recalibrate the inputs.

⚠️ Data Source Identification
If using site files for research, it is crucial to identify and properly cite 
the underlying datasets. Each section of the site file includes relevant data 
sources, which must be reviewed and included in your research citations. Simply
citing the site package is not sufficient.

⚠️ Plasmodium vivax Simulations
While site files include fitted EIRs and options to model Plasmodium vivax, it’s
important to note that malariasimulation is primarily a model for Plasmodium 
falciparum. Any outputs for Plasmodium vivax should be treated as crude 
approximations that do not fully capture the unique biological and control 
dynamics of this species. Use with caution.

With these limitations in mind, let’s proceed to run a single site simulation 
and see how the site files can be applied in practice.

### Example: Running a Single Site Simulation

Using the site package, we’ll demonstrate how to set up and run a simulation 
for a single site.
