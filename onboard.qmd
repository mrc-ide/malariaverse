## ðŸ˜Š Welcome!

Welcome to our malaria modelling group! We're excited to have you on board and hope this page helps you get started with the resources, tools, and community that will support your journey.

This page is here to help you settle in - diving into our model vignettes and published papers will give you the best foundation. Feel free to explore, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with questions, a good place is the malaria group teams channel.
